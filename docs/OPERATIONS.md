# Operations

Operating notes: where everything lives, how to back up by hand, how a scan behaves when it
is interrupted, and what to do when network storage misbehaves.
Current workspace: `~/PhotoSearch`; open its `PhotoSearch.html`.
The existing `~/PhotoSearch.html` is a symbolic link to that same app, not a separate
copy. The Desktop workspace was moved here on 2 October 2026. Older duplicate
copies are recoverable from Trash; see `../WHERE-THINGS-ARE.txt`.
The older measurements below are historical. See [the current review](CONSUMER-REVIEW.md)
for the live library audit and the people/search update at the end of this document
for the new face-backup format.

Operating notes: where everything lives, how to back up by hand, and what to do when
network storage misbehaves. Paths below use `/Volumes/Photos` as an example library.

The numbers come from the reference library (6,635 photos on an SMB NAS). Where a command
needs a path, it uses `/Volumes/Photos` as a stand-in for **your own photo folder**; replace
it with your own, as explained in [Finding your index](#finding-your-index).

## Where the files are

### The app

| | |
|---|---|
| `PhotoSearch.html` | The app. One file, about 530 KB. Double-click to open in Chrome. |
| `PhotoSearch-dev/` | Source code and build script (a git clone of the repository). |
| `~/PhotoSearch/PhotoSearch.html` | The current app. Double-click to open in Chrome. |
| `~/PhotoSearch.html` | Symbolic link to the current app; keeps the existing browser URL working. |
| `~/PhotoSearch/` | Active source, build script, review and roadmap. |
| GitHub | https://github.com/giuvilas/Local-aiPhotos |

To use it on another machine, copy **`PhotoSearch.html`** only. Nothing else is needed except
Chrome and a model server.

### The index: your scanned data

The index is a folder named **`.photoindex`**, hidden because of the leading dot. In the
reference library that was `/Volumes/Photos/.photoindex/`. Yours is wherever
[Finding your index](#finding-your-index) says.

| file | size | what it is |
|---|---:|---|
| `records.jsonl` | 29 MB | **The valuable one.** One JSON object per photo: every caption, description, object list, date and place. It represents 68 hours of scanning. |
| `vectors.bin` | 20 MB | Embeddings: 768 float32 numbers per photo, for semantic search. |
| `vectors.json` | 125 KB | Which row of `vectors.bin` belongs to which photo. |
| `thumbs/` | 226 MB | One 384px JPEG per photo, named `<id>.jpg`. |
| `faces/` | varies | Face geometry, vectors, aligned crops and the names you gave people. Deleted by one button under Explore → People. |
| `config.json` | 7 KB | Settings, the extraction schema, and the hashes that detect when records are out of date. |
| `runs.jsonl` | 9 KB | One line per scan: when, how long, how many, every error. |
| `state.json` | 55 B | Resume checkpoint. 55 bytes means "nothing pending"; the scan finished. |
| `geo/` | 3.8 MB | Cached place-name data (170,540 cities), so GPS becomes "Staines, GB" offline. |
| `backups/` | | Copies made by the app. |

### Finding your index

The index is always a folder called `.photoindex` **inside one parent folder**, and which
parent depends on a setting:

| *Where to save the index* in Settings | the index is at |
|---|---|
| **Beside the photos** (the default) | `<the photo folder you picked>/.photoindex` |
| **A folder I choose** | `<the folder you chose>/.photoindex` |

Settings shows this as "Saving the index to *name*/.photoindex/". It shows only the folder's
**name**, not its full path, because a browser does not reveal full paths to a page. You
already know where that folder is, so:

- **In Terminal**, give `open` the full path to *your* folder:
  ```bash
  open "/path/to/your/photo-folder/.photoindex"
  ```
  For example `open "/Volumes/Photos/.photoindex"` if your photos are in `/Volumes/Photos`.
- **In Finder**, open your photo (or index) folder and press **Cmd+Shift+.** to show hidden
  files, then open `.photoindex`. Or press **Cmd+Shift+G** and type the path.
- **Without leaving the app**, *Settings → What's in it?* lists every file in the index with
  its size.

A bare `open .photoindex` only works if your terminal is already inside the parent folder.

## Backing up by hand

The in-app button can be unreliable against a slow NAS (see
[Known problem: slow network storage](#known-problem-slow-network-storage)). This always works:

```bash
INDEX="/Volumes/Photos/.photoindex"        # change this to YOUR index folder
DEST=~/PhotoSearch-backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M)
mkdir -p "$DEST"
cp -p "$INDEX"/{records.jsonl,vectors.bin,vectors.json,config.json,runs.jsonl} "$DEST"/
ls -la "$DEST"
```

If your shell cannot read that folder (macOS privacy restrictions), use Finder instead: open
the index folder (see [Finding your index](#finding-your-index)) and drag those five files
somewhere.

**Verify that a backup is readable:**

```bash
python3 -c "
import json,sys
n=bad=0; ids=set()
for l in open(sys.argv[1]):
    if not l.strip(): continue
    n+=1
    try: ids.add(json.loads(l)['id'])
    except Exception: bad+=1
print(f'{n} lines, {len(ids)} photos, {bad} unreadable')
" ~/PhotoSearch-backups/*/records.jsonl
```

Expect `6635 lines, 6635 photos, 0 unreadable` for the reference library. A library that has
been rescanned or had photos removed has more lines than photos, because the file is
append-only and the last line for an id wins.

### Thumbnails are deliberately not backed up

They are 226 MB of the 275 MB index, whereas `records.jsonl` is the only file that cost 68
hours. Getting thumbnails back is cheap: **Scan → Maintenance → Rebuild thumbnails**. It lists what is
already there, works out which photos have no thumbnail, finds those originals in the folder
you have open, and remakes the missing ones. **No model is involved**; it is a decode and a
resize, so it runs at disk speed rather than at 21 seconds a photo.

- Photos are found by **content**, so a library reorganised since the scan still rebuilds
  correctly.
- If some photos live in a folder you do not currently have open, it says how many and
  rebuilds the rest. Open that folder afterwards and run it again.
- **Nothing in the index is rewritten.** Captions, dates, places and embeddings are not
  touched, and error records are left alone.
- Thumbnails belonging to photos no longer in the index are reported but **never deleted**.
  The command rebuilds; it does not tidy.
- It can be paused and stopped like a scan, and picks up where it left off next time.

Listing `thumbs/` takes about 75 seconds on this NAS, so expect the count to take that long
before the rebuild itself starts.

### Restoring

Copy the files back into your index folder, overwriting; then reload the app,
reconnect the folder and press **Refresh plan**.

A backup made by the app contains four files: `records.jsonl`, `vectors.bin`, `vectors.json`
and `config.json`. The shell command above also takes `runs.jsonl`, which is history rather
than data. `state.json` is a resume checkpoint and is *not* worth restoring, since an old one
points at a queue that no longer applies. Delete it and press **Refresh plan** instead.

Photos you removed from the Library are restored along with the rest, because `hidden` is a
field in `records.jsonl`.

## How a scan works

For each photo:

1. **Read** the file (retried three times; network shares drop reads).
2. **Decode and resize** in a background thread: a 1024px JPEG for the model and a 384px
   thumbnail for the index. EXIF rotation is applied here.
3. **Read EXIF**: date, camera, GPS. The date's *source* and *confidence* are recorded,
   because EXIF is often an export time rather than when the photo was taken.
4. **Ask the model**, sending the image and a fixed JSON schema. The schema is what stops the
   model "thinking" out loud, which would cost 20 times the tokens.
5. **Validate** in JavaScript: length caps, allowed values, singular nouns.
6. **Correct `image_type`** using the filename, camera tags, pixel dimensions and the model's
   own caption. Left alone, it calls almost everything a "photo".
7. **Extra text pass** for screenshots and documents, which reads far more text than the
   main pass.
8. **Resolve GPS** to a place name offline, and work out season, weekday and occasion.
9. **Embed** a text summary for semantic search.

Results are written to disk every 25 photos, along with a checkpoint.

**Before the first photo**, pressing Scan takes a safety copy of the existing index. On a
29 MB `records.jsonl` over a slow share, that is a couple of minutes on its own. The progress
card appears immediately and names each step, so the wait is visible rather than looking like
a button that did nothing. Stop works during that phase too.

**Speed is about 21.5 seconds per photo.** The reference scan of 6,621 photos took 68 hours.
Concurrency does not help, because the model server processes one request at a time unless
configured otherwise.

## If a scan is interrupted

**You never start from zero.** The plan compares what is on disk with what is in
`records.jsonl`:

- no record → **new**
- file changed since it was scanned → **changed**
- recorded as an error → **failed**
- schema, prompt or model changed since → **stale**

**Scan new & changed** picks up exactly what is missing. The worst case after a crash is
re-scanning the last 25 photos.

Photos are identified by their *content* (name + size + modified time, confirmed by a hash of
the first 64 KB), not by their path, so moving folders around does not cause rescans.

[↑ Back to Index](#index)

---

## How search works

There is no database. Everything is loaded into memory from `records.jsonl` and
`vectors.bin`:

- **Keywords:** BM25 over caption, description, objects, activities and visible text.
- **Meaning:** cosine similarity over the embeddings.
- **Merged** by reciprocal rank fusion, with a relevance floor so a nonsense query returns
  nothing rather than confident junk.
- **`"Quoted phrases"`** must match exactly.
- **Hidden photos** (removed from the Library) are never returned.

Chat sends your question plus nine tool definitions to the model. The model chooses which tool
to call; **the tools run locally** and return only small summaries, so the model never sees
your index. The one exception is `look_at_photos`, which sends up to six thumbnails back for a
visual question.

## Known problem: slow network storage

Measured on a WD PR4100 NAS over SMB:

| operation | time |
|---|---:|
| write 5 bytes, drives awake | 0.05 – 0.92 s |
| write 5 bytes, drives asleep | 24 s |
| copy 29 MB | 67.5 s (about 430 KB/s) |
| **list `thumbs/` (6,568 files)** | **75.6 s** |
| list `.photoindex/` (sometimes) | **over 120 s: no response** |

The last row is the problem. It is not specific to the app: a plain `ls` from the command line
hangs the same way. Directory operations on this share intermittently stop responding, and
nothing in a browser can work around that.

**What the app does about it**

- **It measures your storage on connect** and says what it found, in Settings under the index
  location (for example "storage: 24000 ms per operation (very slow, likely a sleeping network
  share); deadlines 180s"). Every time limit is then sized from that measurement rather than a
  fixed number. This is why the backup used to give up after 30 seconds on a share that needs
  24 just to wake.
- **Nothing sits on a label any more.** If an operation stalls, it fails with both what it was
  attempting and how far it got: "opening the index did not finish within 180s [stuck at:
  Reading config.json…]". That names the step, which is the difference between a report and a
  shrug.
- **Opening the index never touches `thumbs/`**, the 75-second row above. That folder is opened
  only when a thumbnail is actually displayed.
- **Writes are checked, not assumed.** After appending records, the file is re-read and its
  length compared. A write that came back short is reported instead of being treated as saved.

**Still true**

- If the share genuinely stops responding, nothing in a browser can fix it. The shell command
  in [Backing up by hand](#backing-up-by-hand) is the fallback, and it always works.
- Scanning is mostly model time with occasional writes, which is why it ran for 68 hours
  without trouble while single operations were failing.

There is no "move the index elsewhere" command. If you want the index somewhere faster, set
**Where to save the index** to a local folder in Settings and rescan; the photos stay where
they are.

## Settings that matter

| setting | why |
|---|---|
| **Where to save the index** | Beside the photos, or a folder you choose. |
| **Embeddings model** | Without one, search is keyword-only. Adding it later means re-embedding everything. |
| **Scan order** | Newest first by default, so the index is useful on day one of a long scan. |
| **Scan scope** | Optional: work through a big library one folder at a time. |
| **Max tokens** | 2000. Lower values truncate photos containing a lot of text. |
| **Back up after every scan** | On by default; keeps the last 3. |
| **Rebuild thumbnails** (Scan → Maintenance) | Remakes missing thumbnails from the originals. No model time. |

### Library: rotating, removing and restoring photos

To turn a photo, open it and press `R` (right) or `Shift+R` (left), or use the arrows in the
viewer toolbar. In Select mode, the same buttons turn every selected photo. The angle is saved
in `records.jsonl`; the file is not changed, so other apps show the original orientation. An
Undo bar offers to turn it back.

In the **Library** tab, *Select* (or the viewer's *Remove* button) hides photos from the
library, search, chat, the Timeline and People. It changes `records.jsonl` only; the files on
disk are never touched. *Undo* appears for about nine seconds, and *Removed (N)* lists
everything hidden so you can *Restore* it. A rescan does not bring removed photos back.

Because removal appends a record, it is a write to the index. If the index is on a share that
is asleep or read-only, you get an error message and nothing changes on screen.

### Faces

Scanning faces lives under **Scan → Faces**; naming, merging and splitting the groups live
under **Explore → People**. One is a job you start and wait for, the other is browsing.

**Read from** decides the whole character of the run, and the default is **Originals**:

| | Originals (default) | Thumbnails |
|---|---|---|
| decoded at | 2,048 px (`faces.refinePx`) | 384 px |
| reach | only the folder you have open | the **whole index**, whichever folder is connected, because thumbnails are keyed by photo rather than by folder |
| cost on this NAS | 14.3 GB, or 8.9 GB with *Only photos with people* | 214 MB |
| time | ~3 hours | ~8 minutes |
| measured quality | faces well clear of the model's 112 px input | **42% of faces found fell below it**, and the groups returned were mostly one photo each |

Thumbnails were the default until v0.6.26. They are not the cheaper option when the answer has
to be thrown away: see
[FINDINGS §21](FINDINGS.md#21-a-setting-can-be-wired-correctly-and-still-be-undone-downstream).

**Only photos with people** uses the captions the vision pass already paid for — 4,203 of
7,039 photos on this library, 8.9 GB instead of 14.7. It skips a photo only on *positive
evidence of nobody*; a missing or silent `people` field is never treated as evidence.

**Grouping strictness** is not part of the run. It re-groups instantly from vectors already on
disk, so it belongs with the faces it rearranges, under Explore → People, and costs nothing to
try again.

A run is resumable: photos already looked at are skipped, so stopping and pressing it again
carries on. Face rows reach disk every 100 photos **or every 45 seconds**, whichever comes
first, so a crash costs under a minute and a long quiet start no longer looks like a hang.
Progress, speed, time remaining and Pause/Stop are shown where the run was started.

Each stored face records `src` — `"thumb"` or `"original"` — reporting what was **actually
read**, including when a missing thumbnail forced a fall back to the original. It is never
inferred from the setting.

Names you assign are searchable immediately, in the search box and in chat, where
`list_people` tells the model which names exist.

### "Nothing indexed yet" when you know there are photos

The message names the folder it opened, so compare it with **Scan**'s rail or **Settings →
Library**. Three things produce an empty grid:

| what it says | what happened |
|---|---|
| *Nothing indexed yet in **X**/.photoindex/* | that index is real but holds no records — a scan has not run against it |
| *No index in **X**/.photoindex/ — it has no records file* | almost always the wrong folder. Choosing an index location creates `.photoindex` there if it is missing, so an empty one appears wherever you point |
| *Connect a folder in Settings first* | no photo folder and no index folder is open — usually a reload, which drops Chrome's folder permission |

The second is the one that catches people. Picking the *parent* of the folder you meant, or
letting the macOS panel return a highlighted subfolder, gives you a brand-new empty index rather
than an error. Nothing is lost: point *Where to save the index* back at the right folder and the
records are there again.

### Picking a different photo folder

Choosing another folder to scan does **not** move or replace your index. The two settings are
independent:

- **Where to save the index** decides where the data goes.
- The **picked folder** decides which photos are scanned into it.

With the index location fixed, scanning a second folder adds to the *same* index. Photos are
matched by content, not by path, so you can scan a subfolder today and the whole library
tomorrow without duplicates and without anything being wrongly marked missing.

With the index set to live *beside the photos*, each folder you pick gets its own
`.photoindex/`, which is the reason the fixed-location setting exists.

Records from a folder you are not currently looking at are never reported missing. Only
records belonging to the folder actually walked are considered.

## Checklist after any interruption

1. Open `PhotoSearch.html` in Chrome.
2. Reconnect the folder when asked, because Chrome drops permission on reload.
3. **Refresh plan** to see what is outstanding.
4. **Retry failed** recovers anything that errored.
5. Back up with the shell command in [Backing up by hand](#backing-up-by-hand) if the share is
   slow.

5. Back up with the shell command in section 2 if the share is slow.

## People/search update — 1 October 2026

The updated app and source were initially on the Desktop, then consolidated into
`~/PhotoSearch/` on 2 October 2026. The index remains `/Volumes/Photos/.photoindex/`.

New backups include the essential `faces/` records, vector files, `people.json`
(names, corrections and undo), and `people.previous.json`. Face files have checksums.
The older instructions above describe backups that predate face support. Manual
backups must also copy those face files to protect naming work. Face crops and
photo thumbnails are excluded from in-app backups and require originals to regenerate.

Use the current build to restore these backups. Older builds do not understand the
face manifest or correction fields. Restore retains a safety copy; old-format backups
without a face manifest preserve the current faces. A separate-device copy is still
necessary to protect against failure of the NAS itself.

The live library contains historical face vectors. Do not delete them to change
models. See `CONSUMER-REVIEW.md` and the staged migration in `ROADMAP.md` before a
whole-library remeasurement. Existing names remain searchable and correctable.
