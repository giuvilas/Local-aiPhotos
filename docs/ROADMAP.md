# Roadmap

Closing the gap to a mainstream photo manager, without giving up the premise: one HTML file
that works offline against your own disk.

Written on 29 September 2026, after 6,635 photos were indexed and searchable, and updated on
1 October 2026 to record what has since been built.

## Where things stand

What exists is the *hard* half. Every photo has a caption, a description, objects, activities,
transcribed text, a dated and confidence-scored timestamp, an offline place name, an occasion
and a 768-dimension embedding. Search fuses BM25 and cosine similarity, and chat drives nine
tools over it.

The gap was mostly **browsing** and **two whole media types**, not intelligence. Status:

| item | status |
|---|---|
| Timeline (browse by day) | **built**, 30 September 2026 |
| People (face grouping, named only by you) | **built**, 30 September 2026, ArcFace on 1 October |
| Library (all photos in one grid, zoom viewer) | **built**, 1 October 2026 |
| Remove from library (hide, undo, restore) | **built**, 1 October 2026 |
| Rotate photos from the Library (view-only, undoable) | **built**, 1 October 2026 |
| Favourites (hearts, a Favourites tab, a search chip) | **built**, 2 October 2026 |
| Any OpenAI-compatible server, not only LM Studio | **built**, 1 October 2026 |
| Video | not started |
| Perceptual hash, near-duplicates and bursts | not started |
| Place grouping (map view) | not started |
| True image embeddings | not started |
| Search field with suggestions and filter chips | **built**, 1 October 2026 |
| Typo tolerance, free-text query parsing | not started |

This document says what to add, in what order, and what each item actually costs.

## Findings that shape every option

These were measured or verified, not assumed.

### 1. LM Studio cannot embed images

```
$ curl localhost:1234/v1/embeddings -d '{"model":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5",
    "input":[{"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"data:image/png;base64,..."}}]}'
{"error":"'input' field must be a string or an array of strings"}
```

Text input works and returns 768 dimensions. So anything needing an *image* vector (faces,
visual similarity, true image-text search) must run **in the browser**. There is no way to push
it onto the server, however convenient that would be.

### 2. The precedent for that already exists

`exifr`, `libheif-js` and `utif` are fetched from jsDelivr at first use, and the GeoNames city
list is downloaded once and cached into `.photoindex/geo/cities.bin`, after which the app is
offline for ever. Every model below follows that pattern: **fetch once, cache in `.photoindex/`,
never call out again.** No new architectural principle is required.

### 3. `nomic-embed-vision-v1.5` shares the embedding space the index already uses

This is the luckiest fact available. The index is built with `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` at 768
dimensions, and Nomic's vision encoder (92M parameters) is deliberately aligned to *that exact
space*: the text tower was frozen and the image tower trained into it. Consequently:

- image vectors would be directly comparable to the text vectors already on disk;
- a typed query keeps being embedded by the server, for free, with the model already loaded;
- `vectors.bin` stays 768-wide, with no second vector store and no re-embedding of existing text.

The alternative (CLIP, SigLIP, MobileCLIP) is smaller and faster but lives in its own space,
which means shipping *two* encoders and a second vector file. ONNX weights for the Nomic vision
model exist; Transformers.js support has historically been awkward, so plan on
`onnxruntime-web` directly.

### 4. Video is classified and then silently dropped

`classifyFile()` already labels it, and the plan counts it. Nothing else happens (RAW is now read through its embedded preview). For a library with any phone video in it, a meaningful share of the
collection is simply invisible to search and to the Library.

### 5. A second pass over the originals is cheap; a second pass through the model is not

The 68 hours were **entirely** model time at about 21.5 s per photo. Work that only decodes
pixels runs at disk speed: the thumbnail rebuild proves the pipeline, and face detection plus
embedding is on the order of 100 ms per photo on Apple silicon.

> **6,635 photos: about 20 minutes for faces, versus 68 hours for a rescan.**

(In practice the I/O, not the computation, set the cost; see
[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md#11-cost-the-io-not-the-computation).) Everything in Phase 1 was
chosen to need **no model calls**, so it never costs another 68 hours.

[↑ Back to Index](#index)

---

## Phase 1: People, and the browsing you already have the data for

### 1.1 People (face grouping): built

Each original or thumbnail is read, faces are detected, each face is embedded, the vectors are
clustered, and **you** name the clusters. Crops and vectors live in `.photoindex/faces/`.

- **Detection and embedding** run in the browser. Detection and landmarks come from `human`
  v3.3.6. Its built-in embedder was replaced by **ArcFace** on aligned 112×112 crops, once
  measurement showed the first embedder was describing pose rather than identity.
- **Clustering** is greedy against centroids with a member check, cosine distance, and no target
  cluster count. It can be re-run at any time without re-reading a photo, because the vectors
  are on disk.
- **Naming:** clusters start as "Group 1", "Group 2" and so on. Names are authoritative, merging
  and splitting both exist, and `people:"Anna"` filters search and chat.

**The standing rule on identity.** The app never identifies people or guesses anything about
them. Face grouping respects that as built:

- it groups faces that **look alike** and never decides *who* anyone is;
- every name comes from the user, and nothing is inferred, suggested or looked up;
- **age, gender, emotion and ethnicity inference is disabled.** The embedding model computes
  some of them as a side effect, so they are dropped at the adapter boundary, and a test asserts
  they never reach storage;
- face vectors are biometric data. They are written only into `.photoindex/faces/`, never
  transmitted, and one **Delete all face data** button removes them completely.

The `people.age_groups` field in the extraction schema is a separate thing: the vision model's
rough impression of a scene, worth revisiting on its own merits.

### 1.2 Video: not started

Currently invisible. A minimum viable version needs no new model:

1. Decode a handful of frames with `<video>` and `canvas` (no library, no WASM).
2. Send 3–5 evenly spaced frames to the vision model **as one request** with the existing
   schema, plus duration and dimensions.
3. Store a record with `kind: "video"`, a thumbnail from the middle frame, and the same
   captions, objects and text as a photo. Also use the file's creation date and any GPS metadata.

This costs one model call per video rather than per frame, so a few hundred videos is an hour or
two, not days. Audio transcription (Whisper is available in LM Studio) is a separate, later
question.

**Cost:** medium build, with model time proportional to video count. **Risk:** low, since codec
support is whatever Chrome already plays. The Library and viewer would need a video tile.

### 1.3 Timeline browsing: built

A Timeline tab grouped by day, newest first, with place and occasion headings, a year bar and a
date picker that lands on the nearest earlier day when the exact one has no photos. Uncertain
dates are marked per photo with their source in the tooltip. Thumbnails are **windowed**: only
days near the viewport are filled, and a day that scrolls away releases its images and unpins
them.

### 1.4 Library and remove: built

The Library is the flat counterpart to the Timeline: every photo in one virtualised grid with a
size slider, and a full-window viewer that grows out of the clicked tile. Photos can be removed
from the library (select several, or remove from the viewer), with an undo and a Removed list.
Removal is index-only and never touches the files. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#browsing-library-and-timeline).

### 1.5 Map view: not started

GPS is resolved to offline place names already. A clustered-pin map needs an offline tile source
or a plain coordinate scatter with place labels. An online tile server would break the offline
rule, so the honest first version is **place-name grouping**: "Staines (412)", "Sicily (88)",
drilling into a grid.

**Cost:** low for place grouping, medium for real tiles. **Risk:** low.

### 1.6 Near-duplicates, bursts and best shot: not started

A 64-bit perceptual hash (dHash) per photo costs nothing at scan time and about a second across
the library at query time. It gives duplicate detection, burst grouping (near-identical hash
within seconds of each other) and a "review 8 near-identical shots" screen. Combined with the
existing `quality` field, the app can propose a best-of-burst. It proposes only, and the
Library's Remove (which hides, never deletes) is the natural action to attach to it.

**Cost:** low. **Risk:** low. **Add the hash to the scan now**, even if the UI comes later, so it
does not need another pass.

---

## Phase 2: Better search

### 2.1 True image embeddings

Today's "semantic" search embeds a *text summary of what the model said*. If the caption never
mentions a red car, no amount of cosine similarity finds one. Real image vectors fix the class
of query where the caption simply missed something, and give visual similarity ("more like
this") for free.

Use `nomic-embed-vision-v1.5` via `onnxruntime-web`, for the reasons in finding 3: it lands in
the space the index already uses, and the query side stays on the model server. Store the
vectors alongside the existing ones and fuse them as a third ranker in the RRF that already
exists.

**Cost:** one pass over originals (about 1–2 hours, no model calls), plus a model download in the
90–370 MB range depending on quantisation, by far the largest download in this document and the
main argument for MobileCLIP instead if that proves unacceptable. **Risk:** medium-high. This is
the one item to prove, download and runtime, on the user's machine before committing.

### 2.2 Query understanding: partly built

The header search field now covers the structured half: pick a person, a place, a year or a kind
of picture and the filters combine. What is still missing is *parsing* a typed sentence into
those filters.

"Photos of Anna in Sicily last summer" should decompose into a person filter, a place filter
and a date range, rather than being embedded whole. The chat agent already has the tools; this
is about doing the same for the plain search box too, so that `people:`, `year:`, `place:` and
`has:text` work next to free text.

**Cost:** low to medium. **Risk:** low.

### 2.3 Typo tolerance and synonyms

BM25 is exact. "pizzza" finds nothing, and "bike" does not find "bicycle". A trigram fallback
covers the former; the embeddings largely cover the latter already.

**Cost:** low. **Risk:** low.

### 2.4 A retrieval test set

Keep 30–50 queries with known-good photo ids and report recall@k in the self-test. Without one,
there is no way to tell whether a change to the embedder, the fusion weights or the prompt made
search better or worse.

**Cost:** low. **Risk:** low.

## Phase 3: Nice to have

| item | note |
|---|---|
| **Albums** | User-curated collections in `.photoindex/`. Favourites (a single built-in collection) is already built; named albums are the same idea with a name. Select mode is the natural way to build them. |
| **Saved searches** | A query kept as a live "smart album". |
| **On this day** | Trivial now that the Timeline exists. |
| **Export** | Copy a selection or search result to a folder of your choice, or a contact-sheet HTML. Exporting to your own disk is not sharing. |
| **Index integrity check** | Report orphaned vectors and thumbnails and records whose file is gone; repair only on confirmation. |
| **Re-extract by version** | Offer to re-run extraction only for records made with an older prompt, to avoid a full rescan when the prompt improves. |
| **One viewer everywhere** | Open the Library viewer from Chat and Timeline results too, so they gain arrow-key stepping, Remove and Rotate. (Their tiles already show the saved rotation.) |
| **Write rotation to the file** | An opt-in "apply to the file" for users who want other apps to agree. It would be the first feature that modifies originals, so it needs its own safeguards. |
| **Pets as first-class** | Google Photos groups pets. The same clustering machinery applied to the `animals` field. |
| **True RAW decoding** | RAW files are read through their embedded JPEG preview (0.6.5). Decoding the sensor data in a browser is not planned. |
| **Live/Motion photos** | Recognise the paired video and treat it as one item. |
| **Audio transcription for video** | Whisper via LM Studio. Big payoff for home video, but its own project. |

## Explicitly out of scope

Sharing, cloud sync, editing, auto-enhance, and anything that uploads a photo anywhere. The
premise is one HTML file that works offline against your own disk. For the same reason, nothing
outside `.photoindex/` is ever modified: removing a photo hides it in the index, and never
deletes the file.

## Recommended order

1. ~~**Timeline (1.3)**~~ done, 30 September 2026.
2. ~~**People (1.1)**~~ done, 30 September 2026.
3. ~~**Library and remove (1.4)**~~ done, 1 October 2026.
4. **Perceptual hash into the scan (1.6).** Cheap, and it avoids a future re-pass. It is now the
   most urgent item, because every scan done without it is a scan that will need repeating.
5. **Query understanding and typo tolerance (2.2, 2.3).** Low cost, and they improve the box
   people use most.
6. **Video (1.2).** Closes the one gap where content is entirely invisible.
7. **Place grouping (1.5)**, then the near-duplicate review screen (1.6).
8. **Image embeddings (2.1).** The last of the substantial items, because it is the largest
   download and the least certain.

Ordered this way, the early items cost roughly a day of compute between them and **no model
time at all**. Nothing here requires rescanning what you already have.

# Roadmap: dependable local photo finding

Updated 1 October 2026. Evidence and current limits:
[CONSUMER-REVIEW.md](CONSUMER-REVIEW.md).

The outcome is “I can find the people and moments I remember, and correcting a
mistake improves future results.” Scene metadata, recognition, recovery and a
clear search interface all contribute. The single-file app remains the delivery
format; a companion service is a later decision justified by measured limits.

[↑ Back to Index](#index)


## Delivered in this change

1. Persistent face separations/rejections, conservative matching, a review queue,
   saved undo, conflict notices and clearer People controls.
2. Direct Search with required people filters, exclusions, date/place controls,
   keyword-only operation, optional semantic ranking and full-result pagination.
3. Verified face-data backups, source validation on restore, protection against
   pruning the restore source, checked people saves and library cache isolation.

These are foundations, not parity with Google Photos. Historical names and
measurements are preserved. Finish recovery and safe migration before promising
better recognition across this library.

## Milestones

Effort estimates assume one experienced developer, excluding model compute and
user labelling. Owners are roles to assign.

| Milestone | Owner | Estimate | Dependency | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MU: the Photos-style interface** | **Product/frontend engineer** | **9.5–11.5 days** | **PR #1 merged** | **Visual parity with the fork, no contrast or keyboard regressions** |
| M0: recoverable library | Storage engineer | 5–8 days | Delivered recovery changes | Crash matrix and independent-device restore pass |
| M1: trustworthy people | ML/application engineer | 8–12 days | M0, labelled pilot | Held-out recognition targets; corrections survive migration |
| M2: search intent and quality | Search engineer | 6–10 days | Stable person IDs, query benchmark | Retrieval and interpretation targets met |
| M3: everyday experience | Product/frontend engineer | 5–8 days | M0; overlap M1/M2 | Five-person usability study passes core tasks |
| M4: scale and coverage | Application engineer | 8–15 days | M0–M3 | 100k benchmark, media and offline-restart gates |

## RS — three tabs: Explore, Scan, Settings

**This is now the first milestone**, ahead of MU, on the owner's instruction after reviewing a
working prototype (4 October 2026). The full proposal, with every one of the 80 controls mapped
to its new home, is **[UI-REDESIGN.md](UI-REDESIGN.md)**.

The app has 8 top-level tabs and 80 controls, and five of those tabs show the *same photos
arranged differently*. Library, Favourites, Timeline, People and Search results are one grid
with a different filter or grouping, and each is a dead end: finding a photo in Search and then
wanting it by date means starting again.

| phase | work | days |
|---|---|---:|
| RS-1 | Routing and shell: three tabs, lens and scope controls, rail, hash routes, state preserved across lens switches | 2 |
| RS-2 | Explore: Favourites becomes a scope; Timeline and People become lenses | 1.5 |
| RS-3 | Search unification — delete the Search tab, fold its exclusion, dates and toggles into the header field | 1 |
| RS-4 | Scan: Photos · Faces · Maintenance, with a status rail | 1.5 |
| RS-5 | Settings: Connection · Library · Scanning · Privacy & data · Diagnostics | 1.5 |
| RS-6 | Chat drawer; its answers populate the grid behind it | 1 |
| RS-7 | ⌘K command palette | 1 |
| RS-8 | Visual pass — **this is MU-01**, applied once across three tabs instead of eight | 2 |

**8.5 days of reorganisation (RS-1…RS-6) plus 3 days of new work.** RS-8 *is* MU-01, so this
milestone absorbs the visual work rather than competing with it, and re-skinning three tabs is
cheaper than re-skinning eight. **RS-1 + RS-2 + RS-3 (4.5 days) removes three tabs and makes
search work across every arrangement** — most of the felt improvement.

**RS-1 is the bet.** If scope, search, selection and scroll cannot be preserved across a lens
switch, the redesign loses its point; build that first and stop if it does not hold.

---

## MU — the Photos-style interface

**Superseded in part by RS above**, which absorbs MU-01 as RS-8 and replaces MU-02's tab rail
with the three-tab shell. MU-03 onwards (the grid and viewer) still stands.

It was ordered ahead of M0 on the owner's instruction.
Stated once and then accepted: M0 carries data-integrity work rated P0, and running a
visual programme first means those defects stay open for longer. The mitigation is that
every MU step below is presentation-only except where it says otherwise, so none of them
makes the P0s worse.

The design to adopt is in the fork at `giulianoberteo/aiPhotos`, which became PR #1. Phase
costs come from a file-level review of that branch; the reasoning is in
`scratchpad/review/01-ui.md`.

### What makes their interface theirs

Five ideas carry the look. Adopting the first two gets most of the visual change:

1. **A context-switching canvas.** `body:has(#tab-library:not([hidden])){--bg:var(--lib)}`
   with `main{max-width:none}`, so photo screens go full-bleed while settings and scan stay
   as cards.
2. **Borders out, shadow and glass in.** `backdrop-filter:saturate(180%) blur(22px)`, pill
   buttons, radius 10 to 16px, circular 72px face tiles, accent-tinted secondary buttons.
3. **`--hdr:52px` as a layout contract.** A fixed-height glass header with a centred
   segmented tab rail. `.tlbar` and the timeline day headings both position against it, so
   the token comes with the header.
4. **Search as chip tokens in the toolbar**, not on a tab, with the person's cropped face as
   the suggestion icon, and results rendered into the Library grid so Select, rotate, remove
   and the viewer work on them unchanged.
5. **Arithmetic virtualisation.** The grid computes its own window with 700px of over-scan
   in one `requestAnimationFrame`, rather than using an IntersectionObserver.

### MU-01: tokens and re-skin (1.5–2 days)

Port the custom properties, the glass and shadow treatment, the pill buttons, the radius
scale and the heading typography. Re-skin the existing Chat, Timeline, People, Scan and
Settings screens against the new tokens. No behaviour changes.

Fix two measured regressions rather than inheriting them. Their `.btn` label contrast is
4.02:1 in light and **3.65:1 in dark**, against 4.55 and 6.12 in the current build, and
their search glyph is 2.92:1 with `#8e8e93` hard-coded inside a data URI, so it ignores the
theme. Keep the current palette's contrast and take their shapes.

Acceptance: every existing screen renders with the new tokens; no text or control falls
below 4.5:1 in either theme; the self-test's hidden-element invariant still passes.

### MU-02: header, tab rail and hash routing (0.5 days)

Adopt the 52px glass header, the centred segmented rail, and per-tab links
(`#library`, `#chat`, `#timeline`, `#people`, `#scan`, `#settings`). Keep `#selftest`
working, and fix a defect in their version while porting: clicking a tab discards a
`#selftest&heic=…` hash, which breaks the documented decode fixture.

Acceptance: every tab is linkable and reloads to the same place; `#selftest` and its
fixture parameters survive navigation.

### MU-03: the Library grid and viewer (4–5 days)

Take `83-library.js` and its markup: the flat gallery, Select mode, rotate, remove, the
full-window viewer with slider, wheel, pinch, drag and double-click zoom, and opening
RAW, HEIC and TIFF at full size.

Three things must be fixed on the way in, all verified in the merged branch:

- **The viewer's keydown handler has no input guard.** Its sibling at `83-library.js:430`
  guards with `e.target.closest("input,textarea,select")`; the viewer's at line 729 does
  not, and line 738 maps Backspace to `vwRemove()`. The viewer contains its own
  `<input type="range" id="vwZr">`, and `openViewer` neither hides the header nor traps
  focus. So arrow keys on the zoom slider navigate photos instead of zooming, and Backspace
  there removes the photo from the library. Copy the guard from line 430.
- **No focus trap and no `aria-modal`** on a `role="dialog"`.
- **`.gheart` is tab-focusable at `opacity:0` with no `:focus-visible`**, so keyboard users
  reach an invisible control.

The `hidden`, `rotation` and `favourite` fields this depends on cross six modules
(`50-validate` reserved fields, `60-derived`, `65-search`, `82-timeline`, `86-peopleui`,
`70-runner` rescan preservation). Land them together or removed photos reappear on some
surfaces. Their `galPersist` also has to respect the `libraryMaintenance` interlock, which
has nine call sites here.

Acceptance: a removed photo is absent from the grid, search, timeline, events and stats;
rotation survives a rescan; no keystroke in a form control mutates the library.

### MU-04: toolbar search with chips (2.5–3 days)

Take `88-search.js`: grouped local suggestions, chip tokens, results in the Library grid.

**This is a product fork, not a merge.** Two search designs now coexist in the build, and
both ship their own self-tests:

| | `88-search.js` (theirs) | `88-searchui.js` (ours) |
|---|---|---|
| Entry point | header field, chips | Search tab, explicit controls |
| Results | Library grid, paged | own list, paged |
| People | chips resolved to photo sets | required-person filter, exclusions |

Decide one of: keep the header field and retire the Search tab; keep both with the tab as
the advanced surface; or merge the tab's filters into the chip grammar. Until that is
decided, rename one module out of slot 88, which currently holds two files.

Two defects to fix while porting: `photo_sets` is unguarded, so a hallucinated tool
argument throws a `TypeError` from `runTool`; and `args.max` removes the 60-result cap that
protects the chat context. Their `month` filter also slices the UTC month while the local
`r.when.month` sits unused.

Acceptance: a person chip returns exactly the photos the Search tab returns for the same
person; no tool argument can throw; the chat cap still holds for chat.

### Out of scope for MU

Nothing in MU changes the index format, the face pipeline or recovery. If a step appears to
need that, it belongs in M0 or M1 instead.

## MN — merging the non-UI changes from PR #1

Reviewed file by file against the merge base; the evidence is in
`scratchpad/review/03-nonui.md`. The reviewer ported their RAW reader to Node and ran it on
three real 85MB Sony ARW files rather than reasoning about it.

| Change | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `50-validate.js` reserving `hidden`, `hidden_at`, `rotation`, `favourite` | take as is |
| `60-derived.js` and `65-search.js` excluding hidden photos | take as is |
| `70-runner.js` preserving user flags across a rescan | take as is |
| `00-core.js` `ERR_HELP` and `humanError` | take as is |
| `30-worker.js` RAW previews | take with changes, see below |
| `90-selftest.js` calling `saveSettings()` in `finally` | **leave** |
| `00-core.js` mock-role sanitiser | leave, dead code |
| `65-search.js` `photo_sets` and `args.max` | take with changes, see MU-04 |

**RAW previews: a real capability, with one serious flaw.** The byte-scan fallback runs
only when the tag walk found nothing usable. For a TIFF-container RAW whose IFD0 holds just
a small thumbnail, the walk "succeeds" with roughly 160 by 120 pixels, so the vision model
captions a thumbnail and the stored `width` and `height` silently become the preview's. On
the evidence of the file layout that describes **Nikon NEF, the format the commit is named
after**, because its large preview lives in MakerNote and is never reached. Fix: run the
byte scan unconditionally, union it with the tagged spans, and trim each span at the next
`FF D9`, which also avoids copying an 85MB Blob per photo.

**Their self-test must not persist settings.** The suite mutates `S.baseUrl`,
`S.structuredMode` and `S.indexChosen` in blocks restored outside a `finally`, so a throw
now writes `structuredMode:"none"` or a localhost base URL into saved settings. That is the
bug class it set out to fix. Keep the `localStorage` snapshot already used here.

**One test gap to close.** Renaming the fixture `raw.CR2` to `one.CR2` means no RAW file
reaches `plan.new` or `runScan`, so the headline behaviour is untested end to end, and the
deleted `plan.counts.raw` assertion was not replaced, leaving `counts.raw` permanently 0,
which the plan summary reads. Add a `raw=` fixture hook beside the documented `heic=` one
and assert `decoder === "raw-preview"` with a long edge of at least 640.

**Unverified, and why.** Only ARW samples exist on this machine, so NEF, CR2, CR3, DNG, ORF,
RW2 and RAF previews are unconfirmed; whether `createImageBitmap` tolerates tens of
megabytes of sensor data after the end-of-image marker is unconfirmed, and it is the only
path for CR3 and RAF; and orientation was verified as arithmetic, not as pixels. The `raw=`
hook above settles all three.

## M0 — recoverable library first

**ST-01: immutable generations (3–4 days).** Introduce a manifest identifying the
committed record, vector and people generation. Stage new files, verify hashes,
byte counts, dimensions and references, then commit one pointer. Keep the previous
generation. Publish memory/checkpoints only after commit. Add a single-writer
library lock and fencing so a timed-out write cannot overwrite newer work.

Acceptance: inject termination/failure before and after every write, close,
verification and pointer update. Reload yields a complete old or new generation,
never a hybrid. Two tabs have at most one writer. Originals are never modified.

**ST-02: backup/recovery UX (1–2 days).** Support a separate-device backup target;
display last verified time, included data and crop/thumbnail regeneration cost.
Offer a read-only recovery screen for damaged people data with a preview of the
previous file and backup versions. Export diagnostics stripped of personal names,
captions, paths, images and vectors by default.

Acceptance: restore a copy of the actual library onto local disk, compare hashes
and counts, then find five known people/photos. Disconnect the NAS at every stage:
the app must show a recoverable error, never success. Preserve the pre-restore copy.
Recover captions without a vision-model rescan.

**ST-03: independent stage jobs (1–2 days).** Track decode, EXIF, face detection,
face embedding, captions, OCR and each embedding space independently. Persist
stage version, success/zero-results/failure, retry count and elapsed time. Add
waiting-for-drive/model, pause, retry and resume states; show indexed coverage.

Acceptance: killing the tab loses at most one uncommitted batch. Zero-face photos
are not repeatedly processed. A caption-model change does not redo faces. An
unavailable share cannot become an empty/missing library.

## M1 — trustworthy people

**PE-01: labelled pilot and evaluation command (2–3 days).** Select 300–500 local
photos covering children across years, siblings/relatives, profiles, spectacles,
low light, small faces, groups, mirrors, collages and no-face images. Keep labels
separate from automatic groups. Split by event/time to prevent near-duplicate
leakage. Report detection recall, false detections, identity precision/recall,
mixed-group rate, fragmentation, unresolved rate and review burden. The six
existing named groups are not reliable ground truth.

Initial held-out targets: automatic identity precision >=99.5%; recall >=90% on
reviewable faces at least 80px wide; zero explicit-rejection violations. Report
small-face and child age-gap results separately, with confidence intervals.
These are targets, not measured results. Prefer unresolved faces to lower
precision; tune thresholds only on the calibration split.

**PE-02: safe model/resolution migration (3–4 days).** Use ST-01 to replace old
1,024-d vectors with the chosen space without appending incompatible dimensions.
Sample original reads to estimate end-to-end I/O time. Detect at a suitable
resolution, align, and store quality/provenance: original face pixels, blur,
pose, detector/model version, source dimensions and crop revision. Re-read
originals if crops are absent or too small; enlargement is not recovered detail.

Maintain one-to-one old/new detection mapping. Preserve names, confirmations,
rejections and separations; ambiguous mappings go to review. Test same-box IDs,
detection reordering, missed detections and partial jobs. Preview conflicts before
switching the generation. Rollback restores previous groups and search results.

For this NAS, start with 100 photos sampled from the 2,674 known to contain faces.
Verify timing, mapping and precision before expanding. Save an independent backup.
Do not ask the user to delete face data to change models.

**PE-03: recognition quality and execution (2–3 days).** Compare the current
detector/ArcFace pipeline with a pinned SCRFD/recognition candidate on PE-01.
Choose by measured accuracy, latency, memory and permitted model use. Add several
confirmed prototypes per person for pose/ageing, quality-weighted comparisons and
calibrated automatic/review thresholds. Compare robust clustering with the greedy
baseline. Move detection, embedding and grouping into workers.

**PE-04: corrections people understand (1–2 days).** Show the face in its original
photo; add “not a face”, move directly to an existing person, cover photo, merge
preview, nicknames, hidden people and review history. Explain suggestions without
presenting cosine similarity as probability. Explicit confirmations may handle
mirrors/collages that automatic same-photo exclusion conservatively leaves apart.

Acceptance: five users can name, merge, split, reject, undo and find someone
without tuning a numeric threshold. Median correction takes under 10 seconds.

## M2 — search intent and quality

**SE-01: explicit query plan (2–3 days).** Add an AST covering person IDs,
include/exclude/any/all, dates, places and free text. Parse known names, aliases,
years, occasions, relative dates and geography with documented timezone/locale.
Show editable chips; ask one choice for ambiguity. “Anna and Ben in Sicily last
summer” must display the interpreted season/date range. Keep literal keyword mode.

Acceptance: a versioned set of at least 100 queries, including duplicate names,
non-Latin names, quotes, exclusions, uncertain dates and boolean language. Require
100% person-constraint correctness and >=95% interpretation accuracy on the
supported grammar. Never silently broaden a requested identity.

**SE-02: image/text hybrid retrieval (2–4 days).** Add separately versioned image
embeddings to find details omitted by captions. Choose a paired text/image encoder
by local benchmark: equal dimensions alone do not imply comparable vectors.
Fuse keywords, scene-text and image rankings after hard person/metadata filters.
Record model revision, preprocessing and normalization for every vector space.

Acceptance: >=100 judged searches with caption misses, screenshots/OCR, objects,
activities and genuine no-match cases. Target Recall@20 >=90% and nDCG@20 >=0.85
on the agreed set. Report people/scene/OCR separately and require no regression
on exact names or phrases. Compare against the existing baseline.

**SE-03: trust and speed (2–3 days).** Explain confirmed/suggested people, date
provenance and retrieval evidence. Add typo suggestions, saved searches, sorting
and image-based similarity. Cache query embeddings, cancel stale requests and
show useful keyword results when the server is unavailable.

Acceptance: warm keyword/person search p95 <250ms at 10k records and <1s at 100k
on the documented reference Mac. Report cold load, NAS thumbnail latency and
embedding time separately. Keep search and corrections keyboard operable.

## M3 — everyday experience

**UX-01: onboarding/reconnect (2 days).** Lead with Search and a sample import.
Explain photo location versus index location. Offer a local cache for NAS
originals once relocation/recovery is safe. Check capabilities, storage health
and model availability. Make faces/EXIF/thumbnails useful before background
captioning finishes. Show measured progress and searchable coverage.

**UX-02: browsing/lightbox (2–3 days).** Add next/previous and keyboard navigation,
people overlays, clear original/thumbnail state, reveal-original, date/place
correction and confidence display. Add favorites, local albums, place browsing
and a date scrubber. Preserve scroll, filters and selection. Virtualize large
groups/days and release unused image resources.

**UX-03: accessibility/usability (1–2 days).** Audit focus order/return, labels,
screen-reader status, contrast, 200% zoom, narrow windows and empty/error/loading
states. Test five participants on connecting, finding two people together,
correcting a false match, reconnecting a drive and restoring a backup. At least
four of five complete each task unaided; no task silently loses data.

## M4 — scale, offline and media coverage

**PL-01: offline asset installation (2–3 days).** Pin immutable model/runtime
revisions and checksums, show download size/progress, verify installation and
recover interrupted downloads. Persist assets intentionally rather than relying
on HTTP caches. Prove detection/search after restarting the browser with networking
disabled. Confirm model distribution terms before product release.

**PL-02: media coverage (3–5 days).** Add video records with timecoded keyframes
and face appearances; add speech transcription as an optional stage. Pair Live
Photos and RAW/JPEG siblings. Show unsupported codecs and decode failures;
metadata-only records should remain browseable. Never imply skipped video is
indexed. Group duplicates/bursts for review without deleting originals.

**PL-03: scale/soak testing (3–5 days).** Benchmark 10k/50k/100k libraries and long
jobs. Measure memory, UI responsiveness, I/O amplification, requests, storage
growth and recovery time. Evaluate a database/cache or companion service only
when measured limits justify it. Scope caches to a library and keep heavy work
off the UI thread.

## Release gates and rollout

1. CI: reproducible build and syntax; repeated same-page regressions; corruption,
   short-write, permission and timeout cases; separate real-model smoke tests
   using pinned artifacts. Synthetic vectors cannot establish recognition accuracy.
2. Recovery: independent backup and restore drill, old-format migration, crash
   matrix and rollback; originals untouched.
3. Private pilot: 100-photo subset, labelled evaluation and measured NAS timings.
   Inspect false positives before expanding to the existing face subset.
4. Library migration: pause/resume, preview and previous generation retained
   until representative results are reviewed.
5. Consumer beta: M0–M3 gates complete; publish measured coverage and remaining
   limits. Feature-gate unfinished media/offline support; do not claim parity.

Track locally: searchable coverage, failed stages, person-constraint failures,
identity precision, correction survival, review burden, p95 search time, time to
first useful result, and last independently verified backup. No telemetry or
personal photo data collection by default.
