# Findings

Measured results, and behaviour that cost real time to discover. Everything here was verified
against a running system rather than inferred from documentation. Where a number is an
estimate and not a measurement, it says so.

Each finding is written the same way: what was observed, why it happens, and what the code
does about it. For how the pieces fit together, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Reference setup, unless stated:** Apple silicon Mac with 32 GB, LM Studio 0.4.12 on the MLX
runtime, `qwen3.5-9b-mlx` (4-bit), and `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5`.

## 1. Structured output suppresses reasoning

Qwen3.5 reasons by default. On a trivial prompt it spent its **entire** 800-token budget
thinking and returned **empty content**:

| request | output tokens | seconds | result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| plain | 799 | 26.7 | `content` empty: truncated mid-thought |
| `response_format: json_schema` | **13** | **2.4** | valid JSON |

Grammar-constrained generation leaves no room for a reasoning pass. Every scan call sends the
schema, so scanning gets "thinking off" for free. This one fact is what makes scanning
practical.

### What does *not* work in LM Studio 0.4.12

All of these were ignored. This was verified by reading the actual prompt via `lms log stream`
(`llm.prediction.input`): every one still ended with an open `<think>` tag.

- `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}`, the documented Qwen switch
- top-level `enable_thinking`, `thinking`, `reasoning: {enabled: false}`
- `reasoning_effort: "none"` or `"minimal"`
- the same options against the native `/api/v0/chat/completions`

The model's own `chat_template.jinja` *does* honour `enable_thinking` (it emits an empty
`<think></think>` block). LM Studio simply never passes the keyword argument through.

### The gotcha that breaks naive clients

Because the template opened a `<think>` tag, LM Studio files the constrained JSON under
**`message.reasoning_content`** and leaves **`message.content` empty**:

```js
const payload = (m.content || "").trim() || (m.reasoning_content || "").trim();
```

A client that reads only `.content` gets an empty string on every single scan.

## 2. The same trick ruins OCR

Asking for one long verbatim string inside a schema lets the model satisfy the grammar and
stop. On a dense slide (ground truth **1,961 characters**):

| approach | output | result |
|---|---:|---|
| schema, one `text` field | **23 tokens** | stopped after the first line |
| no schema | 2,999 tokens | content empty: all budget spent reasoning |
| **schema, `lines: [string]` with `minItems`** | 509 tokens | **1,781 chars** |

A grammar demanding *many* array entries cannot be satisfied by stopping after one. Scored at
word level against macOS Vision OCR as ground truth:

| | recall | precision | F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| flat 300-char cap (original) | 17.8% | 93.3% | 29.9% |
| model's own, uncapped | 72.0% | 96.0% | 82.3% |
| **array-of-lines** | **88.1%** | 94.5% | **91.2%** |

Two lessons. The arbitrary cap was doing most of the damage, and the *shape* of a schema
changes how much a model will produce.

## 3. Throughput: the levers that do not work

Per photo, with the full extraction schema:

| resolution | s/image | tokens |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1024px | 22.6 | 389 |
| 768px | 19.7 | 395 |
| 640px | 18.2 | 378 |

**Token count is flat.** Generation dominates and the image barely registers. Shrinking the
input costs legibility, especially for text, to gain about 19%.

| concurrency | throughput |
|---|---:|
| 1 | 236 img/hour |
| 2 | 231 img/hour |
| 4 | 235 img/hour |

**Also flat.** LM Studio serialises requests unless the model is loaded with `--parallel`.
There is no caching confound: the same image twice gives 20.6s then 20.5s, and three unseen
images average 21.7s.

## 4. Consistency: what you can and cannot rely on

Five images were scanned twice with identical settings:

| field group | agreement |
|---|---:|
| enums and scalars (`image_type`, `scene_type`, `weather`, `mood`) | **94%** |
| `search_keywords` | 64% |
| `activities` | 60% |
| `objects` | 59% |
| `observations` | **31%** |

**Design consequence:** enum filters are dependable and entity lists are not. Search therefore
leans on embeddings and on BM25 over caption and description, not on exact entity matching,
because "sword" on one pass may be "blade" on the next.

[↑ Back to Index](#index)

---

## 5. `image_type` needs help from outside the model

The model defaults almost everything to `photo`, and contradicts itself while doing it. Real
examples where its own caption said otherwise:

- a Google Maps screenshot → `photo`, caption *"A digital map view…"*
- a presentation slide → `photo`, caption *"A presentation slide showing a flowchart"*
- a film poster → `photo`, caption *"A movie poster featuring…"*

It is corrected locally, in priority order: **filename** (`Screenshot 2025-…`), then **camera
EXIF** (a real capture is a photo whatever the model says), then **exact screen dimensions**,
then **keywords in the model's own caption**. All four are free; none needs a second model
call.

[↑ Back to Index](#index)

---

## 6. EXIF dates are frequently wrong

Files that are exported, edited or generated carry the *processing* time in **every** date
field. In one verified example, `DateTimeOriginal`, `CreateDate`, `ModifyDate`,
`DigitalCreationDate`, `DateCreated`, `TimeCreated` and `SubSecTime` all agreed, with
sub-second precision and a timezone offset, and the file had **no Make, Model or Software tags
at all**. The owner was confident the pictures were from years earlier, and nothing in the file
records that.

**The signal that works:** a date from EXIF with *no camera tags* is suspect, because genuine
captures nearly always carry Make and Model. A large gap between `DateTimeOriginal` and
`ModifyDate` indicates an edit.

**Do not hand-roll an EXIF parser.** A naive "first `YYYY:MM:DD` in the bytes" grabs
`ModifyDate`, not `DateTimeOriginal`. Use [exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr), with
the priority `DateTimeOriginal`, `CreateDate`, filename, then `lastModified`.

Filenames beat `lastModified` surprisingly often (`WhatsApp Image 2023-06-10 at 10.06.41`,
`Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 11.44.18`). Only year-first patterns are trusted; `04-07-2012` is
ambiguous and ignored.

## 7. Browser and filesystem behaviour

**Appends cost O(file size).** `createWritable({keepExistingData: true})` copies the whole
file. Measured: 5.2 ms at 0.5 MB, rising to 9.1 ms at 4.9 MB. Rewriting `vectors.bin` in full
was worse, at 19 ms for 12 MB and 105 ms for 61 MB, on every flush. The fix was to append only
new rows and raise the batch size.

**`requestAnimationFrame` never fires in a hidden tab.** Any `await` on a repaint hangs
*forever* when the window is backgrounded or occluded, with no error and no timeout. If you
await a paint for progress updates, always race it against a timer.

**`content-length` is the compressed size.** Streaming a gzipped 17 MB file and computing
`got / content-length` produced "515%". Report bytes, not percentages.

**One file picker at a time.** `showDirectoryPicker` throws *"File picker already active"* for
a second concurrent call. Worse, on macOS the panel helper process
(`com.apple.appkit.xpc.openAndSavePanelService`) can outlive the dialog and block every later
picker until Chrome is quit:

```bash
pkill -9 -f openAndSavePanelService   # clears an orphaned dialog
```

Do **not** disable the button that opened the picker. That can dismiss the dialog and leave a
promise that never settles.

**`libheif-js` 1.18 exports an async factory**, not a namespace:

```js
importScripts(LIBHEIF_URL);
const ns = await libheif();          // NOT `new libheif.HeifDecoder()`
const dec = new ns.HeifDecoder();
```

**Hash width matters.** A 32-bit id collides around 77,000 items (the birthday bound), which is
well inside a real photo library. Ids are 64-bit.

**A `DOMException` keeps its identity in its `name`, not its message, and re-wrapping destroys
that.** A generic retry helper did exactly this:

```js
throw new Error(label + " failed after 3 tries: " + String(last.message || last));
```

It turned `NotFoundError: A requested file or directory could not be found` into a plain
`Error` whose text contains the *message* but not the *name*. Callers testing `/NotFoundError/`
then silently never matched, so "this folder was deleted" became indistinguishable from "the
share is down", and a scan scope pointing at a removed folder hard-failed the entire plan
instead of widening to the library. Carry the original as `cause` and walk the chain:

```js
function isNotFound(e){
  for (let x = e, d = 0; x && d < 5; x = x.cause, d++)
    if (x.name === "NotFoundError") return true;
  return false;
}
```

The same helper also retried genuinely absent entries three times with backoff. A missing file
does not appear by waiting.

**`confirm()` and `alert()` block the renderer main thread indefinitely** when nothing answers
them. In headless Chrome this is not a dialog you cannot see: it is a full stop.
`Runtime.evaluate` stops returning and even `Runtime.enable` never completes, so the page
cannot be queried to find out why. It presents exactly as an infinite loop, with no exception
and no timeout. Any CDP driver must handle `Page.javascriptDialogOpening` (after `Page.enable`,
before navigating), and any code path a test can reach should be assumed to prompt.

## 8. In-memory state outlives the file it came from

The index is loaded into memory once and consulted from there. Every loader must therefore
treat "this file does not exist" as **a value**, an empty index, and not as a reason to return
early:

```js
try { fh = await IDX.dir.getFileHandle("records.jsonl"); }
catch { IDX.loaded = true; return 0; }        // leaves the PREVIOUS index in memory
```

Switching the index to a fresh location left 6,635 records from the old location in memory. The
planner then judged photos against records that location had never held, and the next flush
wrote those foreign records *into* the new index. The sibling loader, `loadVectors`, resets its
state as its first statement and was never affected; that asymmetry is what made the bug hard
to see.

The same class of bug appears wherever memory is updated before the write that justifies it.
`vectors.bin` is the sharpest case: rows are placed by buffer length but indexed by
`ids.length`, so if the two ever disagree, every later embedding maps to *another photo's*
vector. Dying between the `.bin` and `.json` writes produces exactly that disagreement, and only
the "bin is shorter" direction was originally handled. The file on disk is the truth, and the id
list must be reconciled to it in **both** directions.

## 9. A guessed deadline is always wrong somewhere

The backup's time limit went 30s, then 120s, then 120s again, raised each time after it fired
on storage that was slow rather than broken. No constant can be right for both a local SSD and
a sleeping SMB share. These were measured on the same hardware:

| operation | local SSD | NAS awake | NAS asleep |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| open a directory handle | < 1 ms | ~50 ms | **24 s** |
| read a small file | < 1 ms | ~90 ms | ~900 ms |
| list a 6,568-file folder | ~15 ms | **75.6 s** | 75.6 s+ |

That is four orders of magnitude on the first row. A limit generous enough for the third column
is no limit at all for the first, and one tuned for the first fails constantly in the third.

**Measure instead.** Opening `.photoindex/` and reading `config.json` happen on every index
open, so timing them costs nothing, and the slowest observed round trip becomes the unit that
every deadline is expressed in. Unmeasured storage gets the floor rather than an optimistic
guess; assuming it is fast is precisely the mistake that produced a 30-second deadline on a
share needing 24 seconds to wake up.

**And report the step, not just the failure.** "Backup failed" is unactionable, whereas
"opening the index did not finish within 180s [stuck at: Reading config.json…]" names the
operation that hung. The backup that failed four times in a row reported the least of anything
in the app, which is why it took four attempts to find four different causes.

## 10. A face embedding without alignment describes the pose, not the person

`human`'s descriptor runs on whatever crop it is handed. Disabling `face.mesh` and
`face.detection.rotation` to avoid loading models that were not wanted removed the landmark
alignment the descriptor depends on, and the resulting vectors encoded head angle rather than
identity. Measured on the same drawn face across rotations and scales, against a second face
with different proportions:

| configuration | same face, different pose | different people | separability |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| mesh + rotation **off** | 0.527 | 0.393 | **0.134** |
| mesh + rotation **on** | **0.925** | 0.586 | **0.339** |

Self-similarity is the number that matters. At 0.527, one photo of someone barely resembled
another photo of the same person, so no threshold could separate anybody. The documentation
does say *"it is highly recommended to have face.mesh and face.detection.rotation enabled"*;
for recognition it is not a recommendation but a requirement.

**The threshold has to be measured too.** At 0.55, chosen before any of this was measured, the
cutoff sat *below* the 0.586 that two different faces score, so the clusterer was merging
different people by construction. 0.75 sits between the two.

**Centroid-only clustering cascades.** One wrong face moves the centre, which admits more wrong
faces, and a group becomes a blur of several people. Requiring a candidate to be close to an
actual member as well as to the centroid stops the drift.

**Small faces are noise.** A face 30 px across still yields a descriptor; it is simply not about
that person, and one such face poisons a whole group.

## 11. Cost the I/O, not the computation

The face backfill was estimated at "about 20 minutes for 6,635 photos" from a measurement of the
detector: 8–19 ms per image, with no degradation over hundreds of calls. That number was real
and completely beside the point.

| what is actually read | volume | at the measured 430 KB/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| the original photos | **14.3 GB** (2.2 MB average) | **9.7 hours** |
| the 384px thumbnails already in the index | **214 MB** | **8 minutes** |

The same photos, with 69 times less data. Detection was never the bottleneck. Getting the pixels
off the share was the entire job, and the first version read every original, one at a time.

Three corrections follow, and they generalise:

- **Read what you already have.** Thumbnails are in the index, are the right shape for a
  detector, and cost nothing to produce. They only lose faces that are small in the frame, which
  is a trade worth offering rather than deciding silently.
- **Overlap latency-bound reads.** A share answers one request at a time but happily handles
  several in flight. Reads run five-wide, while detection stays serial because one TensorFlow
  instance is not re-entrant.
- **Size a gate in the unit that matters.** "A face must be 5% of the frame" means 51 px on an
  original and 19 px on a thumbnail. In pixels, the question has one answer.

[↑ Back to Index](#index)

---

## 12. Store the expensive intermediate, not the cheap one

Face recognition has three stages with wildly different costs:

| stage | cost per photo |
|---|---|
| getting the pixels off the share | **~350 ms** (2.2 MB at 430 KB/s) |
| detect + landmarks | ~15 ms |
| embed an aligned crop | ~47 ms |

Changing embedder therefore costs 9.7 hours if the originals have to be re-read, and about a
minute if the **aligned 112×112 crop** was kept. The crop is about 5 KB; 15,000 faces is 75 MB,
against the 226 MB of thumbnails already stored.

That inverts an earlier decision. Display tiles deliberately store no crop, because a box in
0..1 plus the existing thumbnail renders the same picture for free. The *aligned* crop is a
different thing: it is the output of work that cannot be cheaply redone, and keeping it is what
makes trying another model a minute's work and not a day's.

**ArcFace needs that alignment, not a box crop.** It is trained on faces warped onto a fixed
five-point template; hand it a raw rectangle and a recognition model behaves like a texture
matcher. The pipeline is: 468-point mesh, five canonical points (eyes, nose, mouth corners),
least-squares similarity transform, 112×112, then `(x−127.5)/127.5` in NCHW order.

**Two embedders are two different spaces.** `faceres` cosines for one person sit around 0.93,
while ArcFace's sit far lower. A single threshold cannot serve both, so each carries its own,
and a face records which model measured it, because mixing them in one cluster is meaningless.

**Browser facts worth keeping:** `onnxruntime-web` runs from `file://` with
`ort.env.wasm.wasmPaths` pointed at the CDN and `numThreads = 1`, because threads need
`SharedArrayBuffer`, which needs COOP/COEP headers that a local file cannot send. And despite
advertising `access-control-allow-origin: https://huggingface.co` on its redirect, huggingface.co
**does** serve model weights to a `file://` page. jsDelivr's `gh` endpoint returns 133-byte
Git-LFS pointers for model files, which is not obvious until you read what you downloaded.

## 13. Resolution matters, but bigger thumbnails are the wrong lever

ArcFace consumes 112×112. A face **smaller than that in the source** is enlarged into the model,
and the detail was never there. Measured by embedding one face rendered at several scales and
comparing each to the largest:

| face size in the source | cosine against the best |
|---:|---:|
| 412 px | 1.000 (reference) |
| 274 px | 0.965 |
| 217 px | 0.963 |
| 139 px | 0.946 |
| **103 px** | **0.899** |

A 0.10 shift is large when same-person similarity has to be told apart from different-person
similarity. And a **384 px thumbnail only yields a 112 px face when the face fills 29% of the
frame**, which ordinary snapshots do not, so most faces read from thumbnails are upscaled.

**Raising the thumbnail size does not fix it.** Regenerating thumbnails means re-reading every
original (14.3 GB, 9.7 hours here), leaves the index permanently larger, and still bakes in one
fixed compromise. Reading the originals *for the face pass only* costs the same one-time read,
gives full-resolution faces, and, because the aligned 112×112 crop is kept, never has to be paid
again for any future model. There is nothing to gain from storing anything larger than the
crop, because 112×112 is what the model reads.

**The optimisation that makes it affordable:** the thumbnail pass costs 8 minutes and identifies
which photos contain people at all. Only those need re-reading at full size, so the expensive
pass touches a few gigabytes instead of all 14.3.

**Detection is not the constraint.** It works from 384 px to 3000 px at 21–62 ms. An earlier
apparent failure on large images was an artefact of one synthetic drawing, not a size limit.

**Replacing a face must not cost the user their naming.** Re-measuring a photo produces new face
ids (the boxes differ), so old faces are matched to new ones by box overlap and every group
reference is rewritten before the old rows are retired.

## 14. Changing what a setting means needs a migration, like changing its name

`faces.threshold` meant the faceres threshold, around 0.75. When ArcFace arrived it came to mean
the ArcFace threshold, which lives near 0.42: a different space, not a different default.
Nothing migrated, so `{...defaults, ...saved}` quietly applied the saved 0.75 to ArcFace, where
almost nothing merges. The setting sabotaged the model it existed to tune, and the UI displayed
0.75 beside the word "ArcFace" as though that were intended.

A saved value with no sibling key beside it can only have come from the old scheme, which is
enough to migrate on:

```js
if (old.threshold != null && old.faceresThreshold == null){
  old.faceresThreshold = old.threshold;
  delete old.threshold;              // let the new default stand
}
```

**And a control has to be able to express the value.** The slider's floor was `0.50`, so `0.42`
clamped up to `0.50`, silently, to a number the user never chose. Range and value now both
follow the active embedder.

The general rule: renaming a key is obviously a breaking change, and redefining its units is
exactly as breaking while looking like nothing happened.

## 15. Writing the whole file every time is quadratic, and the symptom is silence

The face vector store rewrote `facevecs.bin` in full on every face. At 5,247 faces that is
10.7 MB final and ~5 MB written per face — about **17 hours of pure vector writing** on a
430 KB/s share, longer than reading the photos it came from. The photo-vector path had
appended correctly since the beginning; this one simply never did.

Worse, it published to memory **before** the write succeeded. So one failure made every
later write larger, and the run produced **2,951 aligned face crops beside no vectors and
no face records at all** — crops are written inside `try{}catch{}`, so they accumulated
while nothing was persisted. The visible symptom was a scan that appeared to work.

**A test that measures the result cannot see this.** A full rewrite and an append leave a
byte-identical file, so `fileSize === rows × dim × 4` passes either way — my first attempt
at a regression test asserted exactly that and the mutation sailed through. The assertion
has to measure the bytes *actually written*, which means spying on `createWritable`:

```js
async createWritable(opts){
  keptExisting = !!(opts && opts.keepExistingData);
  const w = await fh.createWritable(opts);
  return { write(d){ wrote += d.byteLength ?? d.size ?? 0; return w.write(d); }, … };
}
```

Then `adding one face writes exactly one row` fails with `288 != 32` when the rewrite comes
back, and `memory is unchanged by a failed write` fails with `10 != 9`.

## 16. A deadline sized from a warm measurement fires on a sleeping drive

Deadlines here are derived from measured storage speed rather than guessed, which fixed one
problem and created its mirror image. Opening the index failed with:

```
opening the index did not finish within 26s [stuck at: Opening .photoindex/…]
```

The arithmetic: 162 ms measured per operation, times cost 4, times factor 40, is 26 seconds.
The 162 ms was real. It was measured while the drive was **awake**. The same share needs
about **24 seconds to answer its first request when the drives are asleep**, which no
throughput measurement taken while it was spinning can see. So the deadline sat barely above
the spin-up cost and the first operation after idle failed on a drive that was merely asleep.

`wakeStorage()` exists for precisely this, and cannot help: it touches `config.json`, so it
needs `IDX.dir`, which only exists once the index is already open. The spin-up is therefore
unavoidably inside the operation being bounded.

The fix is an explicit allowance rather than a bigger number everywhere. While storage has
been quiet longer than `io.idleMs`, deadlines carry `io.spinUpMs` on top of the measured
cost; once it is answering, `S.storage.at` is fresh and deadlines tighten again. For this
share that turns 26 s into 71 s for a cold first open, while a warm failure is still
reported in about 26.

The general shape: **a measurement of a system at work does not describe the same system
starting up**, and a deadline has to cover the worse of the two.

**That allowance was still not enough, and the reason is worth recording.** With it, opening
the index was bounded at 8 s floor plus 45 s allowance, 53 s, and failed again. The table in
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) already said why: listing `.photoindex/` on this share was
measured at **over two minutes with no response**, and `thumbs/` at 75.6 s. The deadline was
below the operation's own recorded worst case, so it was a failure generator rather than a
safety net.

Deriving a bound from throughput only works where the cost is proportional to throughput.
Directory operations here are not: they either answer quickly or stall for minutes, and no
multiple of a warm 162 ms read describes that. Those operations now ask for the ceiling
(`ioCeiling()`), and the deadline keeps only the job it can actually do, which is bounding a
true hang rather than policing speed.

The companion fix is cosmetic but matters as much: a step that may legitimately run for two
minutes now re-emits itself with the time elapsed and the time allowed, because sitting on
one unchanging label is indistinguishable from being wedged, and that ambiguity has cost
more time in this project than any single defect.

---

## 17. One write per item is not a design on slow storage

Measured on the reference share, appending **200 bytes**:

```
cycle 1: append 11,534ms  verify 5,184ms  total 16,718ms
cycle 2: append  3,856ms                  total  4,429ms
cycle 3: append  4,173ms                  total  4,369ms
```

Four to seventeen seconds, for two hundred bytes. Every face wrote a crop file, appended a
vector and appended a row, each preceded by a size read and followed by a verify read, all
serialised through one mutex. About twelve to fifteen round trips per photo.

**A 6,621-photo pass therefore committed one face in nine hours**, with 1,565 of its first
1,575 photos failing on a 105-second per-photo deadline. The readers produced faster than
the writer could commit, the queue grew without bound, and from some point on everything
timed out. The handful of successes were the ones that got through before it built up, which
is why the reported 13.3 s/photo looked survivable: it was the mean of those alone.

Three things follow:

- **Batch everything.** Buffer rows, vectors and crops; flush every hundred photos. Measured
  by counting `createWritable` calls: 30 cycles for 10 photos became 3.
- **One file per item cannot be batched.** Crops were a separate JPEG per face, so six
  thousand faces meant six thousand round trips however the rest was arranged. They now
  append into a single `crops.bin` with each face recording its offset and length, exactly
  as the vectors do.
- **Stop tuning the deadline.** It went 26 s, 53 s, 105 s, and each raise was an argument
  with a measurement that was telling the truth. With nothing else running, a single photo
  read on this share took **58 seconds**; the per-photo bound is now simply the ceiling,
  because its only job is to catch a hang, not to police speed.

**And use what you already paid for.** The captioning pass had already recorded whether each
photo contains people: 4,203 of 7,039 do. Reading only those is 8.9 GB instead of 14.7, for
free. Skip only on positive evidence of nobody, never on a missing field, or a safety filter
becomes a way to lose a library.

| | measured |
|---|---:|
| read throughput, 8 readers, nothing competing | 804 KB/s |
| slowest single file | 58 s |
| 8.9 GB of reading | ~3.2 h |
| write cycles per photo, before / after | 3 / 0.04 |

## 18. Index size

Measured on real photos, then projected:

| photos | records | vectors | thumbnails | total |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10,000 | 50 MB | 31 MB | 329 MB | 0.41 GB |
| 100,000 | 500 MB | 307 MB | **3.3 GB** | 4.10 GB |

Thumbnails dominate at about 80%. A 512px thumbnail at quality 0.75 measured **33 KB each**, not
the roughly 2 KB assumed. Dropping to 384px at quality 0.7 roughly halves the index. They are
also the only part that can be rebuilt without model calls, which is why backups exclude them.

## 19. Hiding a photo is not deleting it

Removing a photo from the Library looks like the existing soft-delete: a record already has a
`deleted` flag, set by **Mark missing**. The obvious implementation reuses it, and it would be
wrong in a way that only shows up on the *next* scan.

The scan plan reads `deleted` as "this record describes a file that is no longer there". A
record flagged that way is skipped when matching files to records, so a file that is still on
disk is classified as **new** and indexed from scratch, which costs about 21 seconds a photo and
brings the removed photo straight back. "Deleted" and "the user does not want to see this" are
different facts with different owners: one is a statement about the disk and the other is a
statement about intent.

So removal uses a separate `hidden` flag:

- the scan plan still matches a hidden record, so the file is **not** rescanned;
- search, chat, the Timeline, statistics and People filter it out (every place that already
  excluded `deleted` now also excludes `hidden`);
- a forced rescan builds a fresh record, so `hidden` is carried over by hand, or the photo would
  reappear after the very action that was supposed to leave it alone;
- the full record is read back from disk before rewriting, because the in-memory copy has had
  `raw_model_json` stripped and appending that would discard the model's output permanently once
  the log is compacted;
- memory is updated only **after** the write succeeds (see finding 8).

## 20. Things outlive the list that created them

A virtualised grid keeps a map from list position to the DOM tile showing it. The Library's
first version cleared tiles by looking up each tile's position in the photo list to find which
thumbnail to unpin:

```js
for (const [i, f] of GAL.shown){ f.remove(); thumbUnpin(GAL.list[i].r.id); }
```

That is correct as long as the list is unchanged. Removing six photos shrank the list, so the
loop read past its end and threw `Cannot read properties of undefined`, which surfaced as a
"Script error" banner. Re-sorting had a quieter version of the same bug: the list stayed the
same length but its order changed, so the wrong thumbnails were unpinned.

The tile must carry what it needs (`dataset.id`) instead of borrowing it from a structure that
can change underneath it. The general rule: anything that outlives a rebuild of its source of
truth, whether a DOM node, a pinned cache entry or a pending callback, has to hold its own
identity.

This was found by driving the real UI with fake data (see
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md#exercising-the-ui-without-a-photo-library)), not by the logic tests,
which built the list and the tiles in separate, tidy steps.

## Reproducing any of this

The measurement scripts are not shipped, but every number above came from either the in-browser
self-test (`PhotoSearch.html#selftest`) or a short script against the model server, for example
`http://localhost:1234`. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
